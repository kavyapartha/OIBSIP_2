            Mother Teresa left her home in 1928 at the age of 18 to join the Sisters Of Loreto at Loreto
            Abbey in Rathfarnham,Ireland,to learn English with the intent of becoming a missionary.
            She arrived India in 1939 and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas.
            Teresa took her solemn vows on 14 May 1937 while she was a teacher at the Loreto convent school in
            Entally, eastern Calcutta.She served there for nearly twenty years and was appointed as headmistress in
            1944.
            Although Teresa enjoyed teaching at the school, she was disturbed by the poverty surrounding her in
            Calcutta.<br>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; color:rgb(224, 38, 100)">Missionaries of Charity</h2>
            In 1948, she began missionary work with the poor.Mother Teresa adopted Indian citizenship,spent several
            months in patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums.
            She founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta.
            At the beginning of 1949, Mother Teresa was joined in
            her effort by a group of young women, and she laid the foundation for a new religious community helping
            the "poorest among the poor".
            On 7 October 1950, Mother Teresa received Vatican permission for the diocesan congregation, which would
            become the Missionaries of Charity.In her words, it would care for "the hungry, the naked, the homeless,
            the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout
            society, people that have became a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone".
            In 1952, Mother Teresa opened her first hospice, taking the help from Calcutta officials.
            The Missionaries of Charity Brothers was founded in 1963, and a contemplative branch of the Sisters
            followed in 1976.<br>

            Responding to requests by many priests, in 1981, Mother Teresa founded the Corpus Christi Movement for
            Priests.

            orphanages, AIDS hospices.

            operating 600 missions, schools and shelters in 120 countries.
            Mother Teresa said, "By blood, I am Albanian.By citizenship, an Indian.By faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to
            my calling,
            I belong to the world. As to my heart, I belong entirely to the Heart of Jesus."
            In 1982, Mother Teresa rescued 37 children trapped in a front-line hospital by brokering a temporary
            cease-fire between the Israeli army and Palestinian guerrillas.
            She began dozens of projects, undeterred by criticism of her stands against abortion and divorce: "No matter
            who says what, you should accept it with a smile and do your own work."
            She visited Armenia after the 1988 earthquake.
            By 1996, the Missionaries of Charity operated 517 missions in over 100 countries.The number of sisters in
